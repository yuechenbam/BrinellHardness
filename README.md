## Instructions for building an ontology in drawio
### Start with drawio
[Drawio](https://app.diagrams.net/) is an online graphic editor. It provides many build-in shapes for creating flowcharts. Users can also desgin and import their own shapes as a library.

### Use Chowlk in drawio
Chowlk is ontology conversion tool based on drawio. It provides a [library](https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/notation.html) with pre-defined shapes representing different concepts in ontology, and using rules.  
By using the Chowlk library in drawio, users can create ontologies graphically, which is a more intuitive way. These plots can then be converted to owl or turtle files using [Chowlk Convertor](https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/) .

### Use drawio plugin for easier life
[The drawio plugin demo](https://github.com/yuechenbam/yuechenbam.github.io) is created by the author to simplify the work. If users want to use some upper-level ontologies, then they can import them in the drawio plugin and use them directly. This way, the user does not need to manually type names or check the details of entities elsewhere.  
By clicking the [drawio interface](https://github.com/yuechenbam/yuechenbam.github.io), users can draw ontologies with this plugin directly.
